A collection of useful bookmarklets. Explanations of each bookmarklet are in that bookmarklet's comments.

These bookmarklets are built using [Daring Fireball: JavaScript Bookmarklet Builder](http://daringfireball.net/2007/03/javascript_bookmarklet_builder).

If you just want to use the bookmarklet, cut and paste the first line of the .js file. If you want to edit the bookmarklet, you'll have to follow the link to the JavaScript Bookmarklet Builder and understand it.
